# Multi View Convolutional Neural Networks Algorithm

MAYAN MENAHEM • RON MALKA • YISHAY NADAV

This project presents an implementation of the article “Multi-view Convolutional Neural Networks for 3D Shape Recognition”. We implemented this article using the Keras library with Tensorflow.
This report will cover the steps of implementation, from input processing to building the convolutional network model, and finally training the model on the given dataset.

Ultimately, we will present our own initiatives for improving the accuracy of the network and optimizing the time consumption.

The entire project report is in the file Multi View Convolutional Neural Networks Algorithm - Final.pdf in this GitHub repository.
